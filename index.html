                    Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Co-created by
                    writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and
                    Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1962, and received his own
                    title with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his creation, Iron Man became a founding member of the
                    superhero team, the Avengers, with Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron Man stories,
                    individually and with the Avengers, have been published consistently since the character's creation.
